## OS
At this time Totem has been developed on Unix based operating systems and if you contributing this is the only supported OS in terms of the tools, servers and other requirements.

### File Structure
The structure your file system outside of the application is largely unimportant, but certain tools such as `Totem Command Line` may need to be tweaked given your file paths.

If you wish to use the default paths the following structure is recommended, all command-line instructions will be referenced using this structure.

```bash
├── projects
│   ├── repos
│   │   ├── thinkspace-api
│   │   ├── thinkspace-client
│   │   ├── totem-api
│   │   ├── totem-client
│   ├── thinkspace (Ember Application)
│   ├── thinkspace-orchid (Rails Application)
│   ├── totem-oauth (Rails Application)
```
